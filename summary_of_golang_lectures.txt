-> when calling a function,

ram allocates some memory for that function (for storing variables)

after function execution is done, that memory won't be allocated anymore

-> why we need or require function? to organize code, reuse code, improve readability and less error prone code! 

->SOLID principle (software engineering philosophy)

-> S of SOLID is single responsibility principle
